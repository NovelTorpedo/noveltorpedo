      With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way
      through the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles,
      as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints.  As often
      as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand, with a
      wary "Wo-ho! so-ho-then!" the near leader violently shook his
      head and everything upon it--like an unusually emphatic horse,
      denying that the coach could be got up the hill.  Whenever the
      leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a nervous
      passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.

      There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed
      in its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest
      and finding none.  A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its
      slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and
      overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might
      do.  It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of
      the coach-lamps but these its own workings, and a few yards of
      road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it, as if
      they had made it all.

      Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill
      by the side of the mail.  All three were wrapped to the cheekbones
      and over the ears, and wore jack-boots.  Not one of the three
      could have said, from anything he saw, what either of the other
      two was like; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers
      from the eyes of the mind, as from the eyes of the body, of his
      two companions.  In those days, travellers were very shy of being
      confidential on a short notice, for anybody on the road might be
      a robber or in league with robbers.  As to the latter, when every
      posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in "the Captain's"
      pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non-descript,
      it was the likeliest thing upon the cards.  So the guard of the
      Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one
      thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter's
      Hill, as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail,
      beating his feet, and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest
      before him, where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or
      eight loaded horse-pistols, deposited on a substratum of cutlass.

      The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard
      suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another
      and the guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman
      was sure of nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he could
      with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two Testaments
      that they were not fit for the journey.

      "Wo-ho!" said the coachman.  "So, then!  One more pull and you're
      at the top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to
      get you to it!--Joe!"

      The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step,
      getting in; the two other passengers were close behind him, and
      about to follow.  He remained on the step, half in the coach and
      half out of; they remained in the road below him.  They all
      looked from the coachman to the guard, and from the guard to the
      coachman, and listened.  The coachman looked back and the guard
      looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up his ears and
      looked back, without contradicting.

      The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and
      labouring of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made
      it very quiet indeed.  The panting of the horses communicated a
      tremulous motion to the coach, as if it were in a state of
      agitation.  The hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps
      to be heard; but at any rate, the quiet pause was audibly
      expressive of people out of breath, and holding the breath, and
      having the pulses quickened by expectation.

      The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.

      "So-ho!" the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar.  "Yo there!
      Stand!  I shall fire!"

      The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering,
      a man's voice called from the mist, "Is that the Dover mail?"

      "Never you mind what it is!" the guard retorted.  "What are you?"

      "_Is_ that the Dover mail?"

      "Why do you want to know?"

      "I want a passenger, if it is."

      "What passenger?"

      "Mr. Jarvis Lorry."

      Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name.
      The guard, the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him
      distrustfully.

      "Keep where you are," the guard called to the voice in the mist,
      "because, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right
      in your lifetime.  Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight."
